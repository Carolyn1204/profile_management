# profile_management

A simple PHP application that lets users upload a profile picture and set a username for  their profile. The application should also display all uploaded profile pictures with their respective  usernames.

# Description

Homepage (index.php):

o Use $_GET to display a message such as "Profile updated successfully!" when the user updates their profile.

o Display a list of all users with their usernames and profile pictures. Use $GLOBALS to achieve this.

o Use $_SESSION to display a greeting message if the user has set a username (e.g., "Welcome, John!").

o Display a link to profile.php where users can update their profile.


Profile Page (profile.php):

o Users should see a form where they can set their username and upload a profile picture.

o Use $_POST to handle the form submission.

o Use $FILES to handle the uploaded profile picture.

o Store the uploaded file in a "uploads" directory on the server.

o Use $_SESSION to store the user's username so that it's accessible across different pages.

o Set a $_COOKIE to store the user's last visit time.

o Once the profile is updated, redirect back to index.php with a success message in the $_GET parameter.
